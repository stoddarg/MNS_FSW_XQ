- Version 1.0 This repository has been created to keep track of the FSW versions which I ship to ASU. They have boards with the XQ chip on them, which means they should be using this bitstream rather than the XC one. That bitstream will work (and has), but it would be ideal if they are using this one. This commit is what they were using to test some of the transfer function problems. 

- Version 1.1 This version includes a new detector number (0/1) for one of the sets of boot files. This is indicated in the folder name; these files have also been uploaded to dropbox for ease of use. Also, the baud rate for these boot files is lower (115200 bps) rather than the previous higher value. This is to try and just get a better transfer for lowering the baud with no other changes. A number of other changes have been implemented with this version, but they are documented starting on p97 of Graham's notes, book 102 (11).
